You can customize the IDE by installing your favorite extensions from the marketplace or custom VSIX extensions.

## Installing extensions from the marketplace

You can browse and install extensions from within your IDE. Bring up the Extensions marketplace available in the left sidebar or select _View -> Extensions_ in the navigation bar.

If you find an extension you want to install, select the _Install_ option. After the extension has been installed, you will have the _Manage_ option available if you want to configure the extension.

## Installing custom VSIX extensions

Start off by _drag and dropping_ your custom .vsix file to the file explorer.
