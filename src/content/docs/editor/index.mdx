While it is recommended to establish an SSH connection to your workspaces from your local device, {t('appName')} allows you to access your workspaces directly in the browser, with a fully-featured collaborative IDE.

## Accessing the IDE

After you [created a workspace](/workspaces/creating-a-new-workspace) you can click the _Open_ button from the menu on the right side of the workspace card or just click on the name of the workspace.

## Sidebar

### File explorer

The File Explorer is used to browse, open, and manage all of the files and folders in your project. You can do many things from the File Explorer widget:

- Create, delete, and rename files and folders.
- Move files and folders with drag and drop.
- Use the context menu to explore all options.

You can _drag and drop_ files from your computer into the file explorer to use them in your project.

### Source control

The IDE has integrated source control management and includes Git support by default. The widget icon will always indicate the number of changes in your repository.

By expanding the widget, you can view a more detailed distribution of your changes:

- Changes
- Staged changes
- Merge changes

The widget header includes multiple useful options:

- Toggle between _Tree view_ and _List view_ of your repository changes
- Commit your changes
- Refresh the Source Control widget
- Add a _Signed-off-by_ trailer at the end of the commit message
- Menu with the most common git commands

### Extensions

You can browse and install extensions from within your IDE. Find more information [here](/editor/extensions).
