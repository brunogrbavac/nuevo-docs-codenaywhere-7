import { t } from "i18next";

Collaboration is just a way of saying "let's work together". When you share an editing session with someone else,
you will be able to write code in parallel in real-time without ever having to worry about merging the changes. {t('appName')} **does not limit the number of concurrent users**.

## Share your workspace with others

Share {t('appName')} workspaces with others by toggling on the Shared property in your dashboard and send the url to anyone who needs to collaborate.

## Collaboration features

{t('appName')} offers a variety of collaboration features intended to improve your workflow, making it an ideal tool for pair programming, interviewing or teaching.

### Live coding

Users can collaborate on projects in real-time, without having to worry about conflicting changes. Cursor tracking allows collaborators to keep track of each others progress, while maintaining focus on their current work.

### Real-time chat

Collaborators can exchange messages directly in the IDE. You can open the chat from the right sidebar.

### Shared terminals

Collaborators have an unlimited number of shared terminals at their disposal. You can open a new shared terminal by selecting the _Terminal -> New Collaboration Terminal_ option in the navigation bar.
