Creating a new workspace from your dashboard is simple.

2. Paste your git repository URL
3. Click create

That's it, your workspace will be created in a few moments and you will be redirected to our browser based [IDE](/editor).

## Need an example project to try a workspace?

Use one of our templates that comes with an example project for that language.
