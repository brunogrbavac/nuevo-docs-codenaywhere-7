You can connect to any of your workspaces via SSH.

There are two ways of establishing an SSH connection and both can be found in the SSH section of each workspaces' menu.

#### 1. Using your Public SSH Key

[Add your public key(s)](/configuration/ssh-keys) in the SSH Keys section to connect to your workspaces using the public key authentication method. This is the equivalent of adding your public key to the `authorized_keys` files.

#### 2. Using an Access Token

Using the Access Token to SSH into a workspace is recommended for quick access, when you want to share your session with a colleague or when installing an SSH key locally is not possible. The Access Token will refresh on every workspace start.

## Connecting with VSCode

Connecting your local VSCode to a workspace requires a few simple steps.

1. Make sure that the [Remote Explorer extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.remote-explorer) is installed in your VSCode.
2. Add a new SSH connection
3. When prompted for the SSH connection URL, paste your prefered method of connecting to the workspace. _(Not sure which method to choose? Find out more in the sections above.)_

And that's it! VSCode will automatically install everything it needs to run inside the workspace and you can use it just as you would locally.

Find out more about the extension [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh).

## Connecting with Jetbrains IDEs

Connecting your local Jetbrains IDEs to a workspace requires a few simple steps.

1. Download the [Jetbrains Gateway](https://www.jetbrains.com/remote-development/gateway/) app to your local machine.
2. Add a new connection.
3. When prompted for the SSH connection URL, paste your prefered method of connecting to the workspace. _(Not sure which method to choose? Find out more in the sections above.)_
4. Choose an IDE you want installed in your workspace.

And that's it! The Jetbrains Gateway will automatically install everything it needs to run inside the workspace and you can use it just as you would locally.
