_Secure Shell Protocol (SSH)_ is the basis for connecting to your {t('appName')} workspaces from a local machine. You can define any number of public SSH keys that can be used to SSH into your workspace using a local IDE, or directly via the command line.

Alternatively, each workspace provides a shell command that allows anyone to connect to a running workspace. The command includes a generated access token that resets on every workspace restart.

## Managing your SSH keys locally

### Installing a supported SSH client

| OS                                        | Instructions                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows 10 1803+ / Server 2016/2019 1803+ | Install the [Windows OpenSSH Client](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse). |
| Earlier Windows                           | Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win).                                                                     |
| macOS                                     | Comes pre-installed.                                                                                                             |
| Debian / Ubuntu / Mint                    | Run `sudo apt-get install openssh-client`                                                                                        |
| RHEL / Fedora / CentOS                    | Run `sudo yum install openssh-clients`                                                                                           |
| Arch / Manjaro                            | Comes pre-installed.                                                                                                             |

> **Note**: PuTTY for Windows is not a supported client

### Create an SSH key

Check to see if you already have an SSH key on your local machine. The key is typically located at `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` on macOS / Linux, and the `.ssh` directory in your user profile folder on Windows (for example `C:\Users\your-user\.ssh\id_ed25519.pub`).

If you do not have a key, run the following command in a local terminal to generate an SSH key pair:

<pre>ssh-keygen -t ed25519</pre>

You will then be prompted to enter a secure passphrase, but you can leave that blank. You should now have a `id_ed25519.pub` file which contains your new public SSH key.

> **Note**: If you are using a legacy system that doesn't support the Ed25519 algorithm, you can use rsa instead: `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096`

> **Tip:** Don't have `ssh-keygen`? Install [a supported SSH client](#installing-a-supported-ssh-client).

### SSH file and folder permissions

**macOS / Linux:**

On your local machine, make sure the following permissions are set:

| Folder / File                             | Permissions                       |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `.ssh` in your user folder                | `chmod 700 ~/.ssh`                |
| `.ssh/config` in your user folder         | `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config`         |
| `.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` in your user folder | `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` |
| Any other key file                        | `chmod 600 /path/to/key/file`     |

**Windows:**

The specific expected permissions can vary depending on the exact SSH implementation you are using. We recommend using the out of box [Windows 10 OpenSSH Client](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_overview).

In this case, make sure that all of the files in the `.ssh` folder for your remote user on the SSH host is owned by you and no other user has permissions to access it. See the [Windows OpenSSH wiki](https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/wiki/Security-protection-of-various-files-in-Win32-OpenSSH) for details.

For all other clients, consult your client's documentation for what the implementation expects.

## Adding public SSH keys to {t('appName')}

Once youâ€™ve created an SSH key pair, you can add it to your {t('appName')} account in the _SSH Keys_ page. Give your key a memorable name, because editing SSH keys is not supported.

It is possible to enable temporary access to your public by setting an expiration date.
