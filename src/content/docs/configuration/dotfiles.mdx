Dotfiles give users a way to customize their workspaces with components that are installed after the workspace is built from the Devcontainer configuration.

These customizations can range from custom terminal configurations to IDE customizations.

To configure {t('appName')} to use your dotfiles, go to the _My Account_ page and paste your repository URL in the _Dotfiles_ section.
