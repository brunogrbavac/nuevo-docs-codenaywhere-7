Environment variables store sensitive information in key-value pairs and are added into each of your workspaces.
This way, all your variables can be safely stored in your {t('appName')} account and accessed while working.

You can define any number of environment variables for your personal workspaces, or an administrator can define them on a team level. After adding them, environment variables can be edited or removed.
